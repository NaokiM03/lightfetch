## Motivation

Others are not distributed in single binary for Windows.

## How to use

- Build it yourself or download the binary from the release page.
- You just have to run the program in terminal.

## Notice

LihgtFetch uses ANSI escape code. Windows Terminal supports it by default, so I recommned it.
